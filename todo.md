* Validate uniqueness and absence of gaps in variable/instruction indices when creating Info objects.
* Implement client side
* Refactor server side regarding Instruction/Variable maps, user interfaces, etc.: mostly done
* Look for bottlenecks: e.g. using std::map with string keys to identify the name server for EPICS
