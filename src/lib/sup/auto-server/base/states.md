# JobController states

## Runner idle

### Procedure not started or paused

'not started' is the initial state when the JobController starts, but can also be reached on Terminate/Reset (there is no such thing in Runner, but it might be required).

'paused' is the state indicating the procedure executed at least one leaf instruction but is not finished yet. It can be reached after a step command, when hitting a breakpoint, etc.

Command response:

* START:
  * Call `ExecuteProcedure()`
  * Runner is no longer idle, but running
  * The tick callback will need to handle the next command(s)
* STEP:
  * Call `ExecuteSingle()`
  * Runner is paused afterwards
* RESET:
  * Reset the procedure (all instructions and variables reset)
  * Runner is in not started afterwards
* All other: ignore and wait for next command

### Procedure finished

The procedure has a finished status (success/failure) and is not yet reset.

Command response:

* RESET:
  * Reset the procedure (all instructions and variables reset)
  * Runner is in not started afterwards
* All other: ignore and wait for next command

## Runner stepping

This is the state during an `ExecuteSingle` call.

The tick callback does not need to process commands, as that will happen immediately afterwards. The callback can handle the switch to the paused or finished state though.

## Runner running

This is the state during am `ExecuteProcedure` call.

Commands need to be handled in the tick callback now.

Command response:

* PAUSE/STEP:
  * Halt the procedure: this prevents the next ticks
  * Set the Runner to paused of finished, depending on the status of the procedure
  * PAUSE/STEP could even be a single command, but maybe that would cause confusion
* RESET:
  * Halt the procedure
  * Reset the procedure (all instructions and variables reset)
  * Runner is in not started afterwards
* Ignore START and immediately handle next command (if any)
